<section name="ISmicro Commons Proximity">

<p>Proximity component is a proxy-like pure Java application.</p>

<subsection name="Using Proximity as corporate Maven proxy">
<p>The initial goal to develop Proximity was to make some alternative to
the existing <a href="http://maven-proxy.codehaus.org">maven-proxy</a> 
application on codehaus.</p>
<p>The Proximity has the following features, that enables it to act as
Maven-aware caching proxy:</p>

<ul>
<li>With pluggable proxying logic it is able to handle snapshot releases in 
"maven-way" (there is a Logic implementation out-of-the-box)</li>
<li>It is possible to define more remote repositories, thus Proximity is
aggregating these repositores and also is caching the and reduces outbound
traffic.</li>
<li>The flexibility to define repositories allows administrator to include
a local only repository to publish in-house artifacts, or other commercial
artifacts that are not found or ibiblio or other mainstream maven repo.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see Proximity in action <a href="/proximity">here</a>!</p>
