<section name="ISmicro Commons Proximity">

<p>Proximity component is a proxy-like pure Java application.</p>

<p>Proximity consists of PX Core module, which is <b>environment and
transport independent</b>, so it is capable to run in J2SE and
J2EE environment too.</p>

<p>The PX Webapp is a thin module (2 classes + some Velocity templates!) based 
on Spring IoC framework and it's MVC implementation, and makes the Proximity 
Servlet implementation.</p>

<subsection name="Using Proximity as corporate Maven proxy">
<p>The initial goal to develop Proximity was to make some alternative to
the existing <a href="http://maven-proxy.codehaus.org">maven-proxy</a> 
application on Codehaus.</p>
<p>The Proximity has the following features, that enables it to act as
Maven-aware caching proxy:</p>

<ul>
<li>With pluggable proxying logic it is able to handle snapshot releases in 
"maven-way" (there is a Logic implementation out-of-the-box)</li>
<li>It is possible to define more remote repositories, thus Proximity is
aggregating these repositores and also is caching the and reduces outbound
traffic.</li>
<li>The flexibility to define repositories allows administrator to include
a local only repository to publish in-house artifacts, or other commercial
artifacts that are not found or ibiblio or other mainstream maven repo.</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast to the maven-proxy implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity Core is transport and environment independent (no javax.* deps) and
embeddable in any environment (one example is PX Webapp + Spring).</li>
<li>More flexible, see <a href="configuration.html">configuration</a>.</li>
<li>Flexible logic implementations. Some repo may have different retrieval
logic, as per Repos configuration allows.</li>
<li>Not fighting against WAR deployment (I need WAR, since one Tomcat
already runs in my office).</li>
</ul>
