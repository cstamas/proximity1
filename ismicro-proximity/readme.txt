=================

A Commons project for generic proxying with pluggable proxy logic.

One of primary use will be as webapp to serve as maven proxy on
company's intranet. As for reducing outgoing traffic (caching ibiblio and other
maven repos), aggregating more repositories (reducing config) with acting
as one logical repository while proxying more remote reposes and as for 
publishing in-house maven artifacts which are not uploadable to ibiblio 
(like commercial projects...).

Have fun!
