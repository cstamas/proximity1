<section name="Latest news">

<p>"Bad" news first: Proximity, aka. "Proximity1 line" or "Proximity RCx line" is deprecated. It will be not developed further,
only bugfixed in very special circumstances (Proximity RCx instences already works flawlessly on many places, so this is next to
unbelievable to happen). User sent patches are accepted, of course.</p>

<p>Heh, and now...</p>

<p><b>The good news:</b> <a href="http://blogs.sonatype.com/jvanzyl/2007/11/21.html">Proximity Lives 
on as Sonatype Nexus for Maven Users</a> (Yes, it remains ASL 2.0 licensed!).</p>

<p>Proximity2, more precisely the "core" engine, will continue to be a heavily customizable "proactive mirror" thingie, but it's 
main "goal" will not be Maven Proxy anymore.</p>

<p>I am an old SuSE/SUSE/openSUSE Linux distro user, and also frustrated that this distro still has no proper Installation
Server (Yes, YaST can do it, but it is not what I want). So, the new px-core engine "appliance" will be just as Proximity1 was for
Maven: openSUSE installation server, RPM-MD repository hosting and proxying and extensive package search engine.</p>

<p>So, existing Proximity Maven Proxy users, you are <b>encouraged</b> to switch to Sonatype Nexus, while others will have to
wait for px2-core engine and Proximity2 openSUSE (codenames Liza, Px2 for Lizards) application till end of this or beginning of the
next 2008. year. Have fun!</p>

<section name="About Proximity">

<p>In short: Proximity is in function somewhere between http-proxy and
proactive-mirror. Proximity <b>is not</b> a HTTP Proxy (something like Squid is). 
It requires Java 1.4.2 platform and is a standard J2EE Web Application
(altough, the px-core engine is pure J2SE application).</p>

<p>One of it's primary use is as Java web application to serve as Maven proxy on our
company's intranet. As for reducing outgoing traffic (caching central and other
maven repos), aggregating more repositories (reducing project config) with acting
as one logical repository and for publishing in-house and other external maven 
artifacts which are not uploadable to "central" (like commercial projects, J2EE
Jars, etc...).</p>

<h3>What is Proximity? (long version)</h3>

<p>Proximity (px-core) is a modular fetch-and-cache engine with various extra capabilities like
indexing. The Px-Core module is driven by Maven bindings (px-core-maven) to implement a Maven 
Proxy application behaviour.</p>

<p>You can look at Proximity as something that comes "in parts" (IKEA furniture, LEGO, etc).
While Proximity delivers itself in "default" flavour and various packaging (bundled and WAR), that should suffice the
most of Maven2 developer needs, Proximity is actually just a "bunch of beans", with
various local and remote peer implementations (you can reach "central" repo even over
FTP, did you know that?). It's like a toolbox, and it is left to you to do the assembling part of it (or just
use the "preassembled" defaults).</p>

<p>Proximity heavily uses the IoC capabilities of the latest containers, this is the reason of it's most
hated (hard to re/configure) or beloved (easy to adapt to any needs) nature. Proximity is container
independent. The default container used with Proximity is Spring Framework, but the are existing
instances working in Plexus too.</p>

<p>The main thing behind "hard to configure" is these two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Container independent</li>
  <li>Proximity <b>is proper configuration</b> of px-core, px-core-maven and other modules as a whole.</li>
</ul>
