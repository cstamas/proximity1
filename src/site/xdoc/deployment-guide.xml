<section name="Deployment guide">

<p>This Guide is <b>work in progress</b>.</p>

<p>The prepackaged WAR Proximity comes with following general configurations (for details see 
<a href="factory-conf.html">Proximity Default Configuration</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>The preconfigured repositories are central (proxied http://repo1.maven.org/maven2), and three hosted ones (inhouse, extNonFree and extFree).</li>
<li>The root of proximity storages are in <b>user home</b> directory.</li>
<li>The Proximity log files are placed in <b>user home</b> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we will see some web container specific tasks for Proximity deployment.</p>

<subsection name="Apache Tomcat">

<p>Proximity has been extensively tested on Tomcat 5.x line. For deployment on Tomcat, you simply need 
to "drop" the WAR file in $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory.</p>

<p>Advanced users may <b>unpack</b> the WAR and gain access to configuration files. Also, please
review the logging settings (Log4j currently), since it may not be suited your needs!</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Jetty">

<p>Proximity has been extensively tested on Jetty 5.11 line. For deployment on Jetty, you need some
additional steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the log4j.jar from Proximity WAR file to the $JETTY_HOME/ext directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, simply "drop" the WAR file in $JETTY_HOME/webapps directory.</p>

<p>Advanced users may <b>unpack</b> the WAR and gain access to configuration files. Also, please
review the logging settings (Log4j currently), since it may not be suited your needs!</p>
