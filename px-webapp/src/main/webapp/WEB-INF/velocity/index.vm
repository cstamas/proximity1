<h2>#springMessage('proximity.product.name')</h2>

<p>Proximity is in function somewhere between http-proxy and
proactive-mirror.</p>

<p>One of it's primary use is as Java web application to serve as maven proxy on our
company's intranet. As for reducing outgoing traffic (caching central and other
maven repos), aggregating more repositories (reducing project config) with acting
as one logical repository and for publishing in-house and other external maven 
artifacts which are not uploadable to ibiblio (like commercial projects, J2EE
Jars, etc...).</p>

<p>The Proximity "factory" setup should be sufficient in almost every situation,
though Proximity itself is very configurable.</p>

Proximity project is hosted on <a href="http://www.abstracthorizon.org/">Abstract Horizon</a>.</p>

<h3>Published Web Services</h3>

<p>Proximity publishes it's partial functionality via SOAP. For WSDL's see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching service WSDL is here: <a href="ws/SearchService?wsdl">ws/SearchService?wsdl</a></li>
<li>Maintenance service WSDL is here: <a href="ws/SearchService?wsdl">ws/SearchService?wsdl</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>Install it as it should with distribution you downloaded. J2EE WAR file should be
deployed on a J2EE servlet container. Bundled releases should be installed as
described in README files.</p>

<p>For WAR distribution: All you have to do is install Proximity WAR on some Servlet 
container that has access to outer world (for reaching central, codehaus, etc. 
This is NOT mandatory since you can use Proximity to serve only your own artifacts!). </p>
