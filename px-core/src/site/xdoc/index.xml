<section name="Proximity Core">

<p>Proximity Core component is a proxy-like pure Java application. PX Core is transport and 
environment independent, thus it may serve in J2SE and J2EE application without a problem!.</p>

<p>The PxCore is just a bunch of beans, with dependencies for only the needed transport and 
storage. Core dependencies are: commons-codec, commons-collections, commons-httpclient and 
commons-logging (needed by previous components and by Core itself). For detailed deps look 
here  maven dependencies report.</p>
